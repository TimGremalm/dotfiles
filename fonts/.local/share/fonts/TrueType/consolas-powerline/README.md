# consolas-powerline
An updated Consolas for Powerline font. This works with the new vim-airline, too.

Font Version: 7.00
Nerd Fonts: 3.1.1

This font version is included in Windows 11 (and 10).

Consolas is a trademark of the Microsoft group of companies.

This font is patched for the latest vim-airline versions, with support for the new glyphs.

This patched font includes glyphs from:

- Powerline Extra Symbols
- Font Awesome
- Font Awesome Extension
- Material Design Icons
- Weather Icons
- Devicons
- Octicons
- Codicons
- Font Logos (Formerly Font Linux)

This font is created *monospaced*, some glyphs will **NOT** look good in SSH clients like PuTTY.

This font is patched with [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).
